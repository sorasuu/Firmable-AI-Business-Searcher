## Deployment Notes

### Current Production Deployment

- **Frontend** ‚Äì Deployed on Vercel at [firmable-ai-business-searcher.vercel.app](https://firmable-ai-business-searcher.vercel.app/)
  - Uses Next.js 14 server actions and edge-friendly APIs
  - Environment variables configured via Vercel dashboard
  - Automatic deployments from `main` branch

- **Backend** ‚Äì Deployed on Railway at [firmable-ai-business-searcher-production.up.railway.app](https://firmable-ai-business-searcher-production.up.railway.app)
  - FastAPI with Docker containerization
  - Rate limiting with in-memory counters (10/min for analyze, 20/min for chat)
  - Automatic deployments from `main` branch

- **Secrets management** ‚Äì Environment variables set in Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend):
  - `API_SECRET_KEY` ‚Äì Bearer token for API authentication
  - `GROQ_API_KEY` ‚Äì Required for LLM analysis
  - `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` ‚Äì Optional, for enhanced scraping
  - `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY` ‚Äì Optional, for semantic search features

### Alternative Deployment Options

- **Backend** ‚Äì Can also run on Render, Heroku, or any Docker-compatible host
- **Scaling** ‚Äì For clustered deployments, configure SlowAPI with Redis or Memcached for distributed rate limitingacked by cached analysis.

The system exposes two authenticated, rate-limited FastAPI endpoints (`/api/analyze` and `/api/chat`) and a Next.js interface that makes those capabilities easier to explore.


## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

## Key Capabilities

- **Single-page intelligence** ‚Äì Uses Firecrawl (when available) or a hardened BeautifulSoup fallback to capture the homepage, normalise the content, and cache it locally.
- **LLM-backed analysis** ‚Äì Groq‚Äôs ChatGroq client (default model `openai/gpt-oss-20b`) infers industry, company size, USP, target audience, sentiment, and more. Outputs are normalised and enriched with supporting text snippets.
- **Contact enrichment** ‚Äì Deterministic parsers combined with LLM validation extract emails, phone numbers, addresses, and social links. `/api/analyze` merges the deterministic results with conversational contact intelligence.
- **Conversational follow-up** ‚Äì `/api/chat` reuses the cached scrape + insight store so follow-up questions, business-intel summaries, or on-demand reports can be generated without re-scraping.
- **Safety & governance** ‚Äì Bearer-token authentication, SlowAPI rate limiting (10/min for analysis, 20/min for chat), structured error envelopes, and request validation via Pydantic.
- **Modern UI** ‚Äì A Next.js 14 frontend with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, server actions, and a chat workspace that mirrors the API contract (including custom questions and report generation).
- **Asynchronous architecture** ‚Äì Non-blocking async/await patterns with thread pool offloading for CPU-intensive operations, enabling concurrent request handling without event loop blocking.

---

## Asynchronous Programming

The application implements asynchronous programming at multiple levels to handle concurrent requests efficiently:

### Implementation Details:

1. **Async Route Handlers**: All API endpoints use `async def` with FastAPI's native async capabilities, allowing the server to handle multiple requests concurrently.

2. **Non-blocking Execution**: Blocking operations (web scraping, LLM API calls, file I/O) are offloaded to thread pools using `asyncio.to_thread()`

3. **Parallel Processing**: `AIAnalyzer` uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` to run multiple LLM inference tasks concurrently, reducing total processing time:
   - Default insights extraction
   - Custom question answering
   - Contact information validation
   - Live website visits (when enabled)

### Performance Benefits:

- **Throughput**: Under load testing, the async architecture handles concurrent requests without blocking
- **Response Time**: Event loop remains responsive to new requests while heavy operations run in background threads
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better CPU utilization through concurrent execution of I/O-bound operations

## High-Level Architecture

The system consists of:

- **Next.js Frontend** (Vercel)  Analyzer form with custom questions, insight cards, contact panels, and chat interface. Uses server actions to call the FastAPI backend with Bearer auth.
- **FastAPI Backend** (Railway/Local)  Two rate-limited endpoints:
  - /api/analyze (10/min)  orchestrator.analyze()
  - /api/chat (20/min)  conversational_agent.chat()
  - Includes rate limiting, auth middleware, and CORS
- **WebsiteScraper**  Firecrawl scrape (primary) with BeautifulSoup fallback, JSONL caching
- **AIAnalyzer**  Groq LLM extracts BusinessInsights (summary, industry, size, USP, etc.) and answers custom questions with sourced snippets
- **ConversationalAgent**  Caches scrape + insight bundle in AnalysisStore, handles chat Q&A, contact enrichment, and business reports

Supporting modules:

- `api/core/*`  shared settings, security, and limiter plumbing
- `api/data_store.py`  lightweight in-memory store with semantic search hooks for cached chunks
- `api/services/container.py`  lazily instantiates Groq clients, scraper, analyzer, and chat agent for dependency injection

---

## Technology Stack & Justification

### Backend Framework: FastAPI

**Why FastAPI?**
- **Async-First Architecture**: Native `async/await` support enables non-blocking I/O operations, critical for handling concurrent web scraping and LLM API calls without blocking the event loop
- **Automatic API Documentation**: Built-in OpenAPI/Swagger integration provides interactive API docs out of the box
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic integration ensures request/response validation at runtime with minimal boilerplate
- **Performance**: One of the fastest Python frameworks, comparable to Node.js and Go in benchmarks
- **Developer Experience**: Minimal code required for production-ready features (auth, CORS, rate limiting)

### Web Scraping: Firecrawl + BeautifulSoup4

**Why Firecrawl (Primary)?**
- **JavaScript Rendering**: Executes client-side JavaScript and waits for dynamic content to load, ensuring single-page applications (React, Vue, Angular) are fully rendered before extraction
- **Anti-Bot Circumvention**: Handles modern bot detection mechanisms (Cloudflare, reCAPTCHA) that would block standard HTTP clients
- **Structured Output**: Returns clean, markdown-formatted content optimized for LLM consumption
- **Reliability**: Cloud-based infrastructure handles complex scenarios (redirects, cookies, session management) that fail with local scraping
- **Scalability Over Playwright, Puperteer**: While Playwright and Puperteer offers similar JavaScript rendering capabilities, running browser instances in the backend is resource-intensive (high memory/CPU usage per session) and doesn't scale well under concurrent load. Firecrawl's cloud-based approach offloads this overhead, enabling the backend to remain lightweight and handle multiple requests efficiently.


**Why BeautifulSoup4 (Fallback)?**
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Works without API keys or network calls when Firecrawl is unavailable
- **Cost Efficiency**: Free fallback for static sites that don't require JavaScript execution
- **Deterministic Parsing**: Direct HTML parsing for sites with server-side rendering
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensures the system remains operational even if external scraping services are down

### AI Infrastructure

**LLM: Groq API with OpenAI GPT-OSS-20B**

**Why Groq?**
- **Blazing Speed**: Industry-leading inference speed (~1,000 tokens/second) powered by custom LPU‚Ñ¢ (Language Processing Unit) architecture, reducing response times from minutes to seconds
- **TruePoint Numerics**: Groq's proprietary quantization reduces precision only in areas that don't affect accuracy, preserving quality while delivering significant speedup over traditional approaches
- **Open-Source Models**: Hosts high-quality open-source models (Llama 3, Mixtral, Gemma, GPT-OSS) avoiding vendor lock-in
- **Cost-Effective**: Competitive pricing ($0.10/10M input tokens, $0.50/2M output tokens) with generous free tier for prototyping
- **Reliability**: Enterprise-grade infrastructure with 99.9% uptime SLA and automatic failover

**Why `openai/gpt-oss-20b` Model?**
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture**: 20B total parameters with efficient sparse activation‚Äîonly a subset of parameters active per token, enabling fast inference with small memory footprint
- **Tool Calling Excellence**: Optimized for agentic workflows with native support for function calling, browser search, and code execution‚Äîcrucial for contact extraction and structured data generation
- **Massive Context Window**: 131K tokens (131,072) supports analyzing multiple homepage sections, product docs, and conversation history without truncation
- **Long Output Capability**: Up to 65,536 max output tokens enables comprehensive business reports, detailed analyses, and multi-turn conversations
- **Reasoning + JSON Modes**: Built-in reasoning capabilities with JSON Object/Schema modes ensure structured, validated outputs for business intelligence tasks
- **Cost-Efficient Deployment**: Compact model size with cached input pricing ($0.05/20M tokens) makes repeated analysis economical

**Embedding Model: BAAI/bge-m3 (via DeepInfra)**

**Why BGE-M3?**
- **Multilingual Excellence**: BGE-M3 (M3 = Multi-lingual, Multi-functionality, Multi-granularity) supports 100+ languages with superior cross-lingual retrieval capabilities
- **MTEB Leaderboard**: Consistently ranks in the top 10 on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), outperforming many larger proprietary models
- **Cost-Effective**: DeepInfra's serverless pricing model charges only for actual usage, no minimum commitments
- **High Familiarity & Reliability**: Extensively tested across diverse embedding tasks with consistent performance (personal experiences)

### `/api/chat` Request/Response

```jsonc
// Request body
{
  "url": "https://n8n.com",
  "query": "Who are their primary competitors?",
  "conversation_history": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What do they build?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "They specialise in workflow automation software."}
  ]
}

// Response
{
  "url": "https://n8n.com",
  "query": "Who are their primary competitors?",
  "response": "Competitive messaging references Zapier, Make.com, and Workato as direct alternatives.",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T22:16:12.009812+00:00"
}
```

The frontend‚Äôs ‚ÄúGenerate Business Report‚Äù button simply poses a long-form question to `/api/chat`

## Local Development

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+ (or npm/yarn if you prefer, but the lockfile is pnpm)
- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (preferred) or pip for Python dependency management
- Groq API key (required) and, optionally, a Firecrawl API key for richer scraping
- e

### 2. Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` in the repo root and fill in the secrets:

```env
API_URL=http://localhost:8000
API_SECRET_KEY=dev-secret-key
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YOUR_KEY
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc_YOUR_KEY          # optional but recommended
DEEPINFRA_API_KEY=di_OPTIONAL_KEY     # optional, used for extended semantic features
```

The same file is consumed by server actions in the Next.js app and the FastAPI backend.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
pnpm install   # or npm install

# Backend
uv sync        # creates an isolated .venv based on pyproject.toml / uv.lock
```

### 4. Run the Stack

```bash
# Terminal 1 ‚Äì FastAPI (reload on change)
uv run uvicorn api.index:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 ‚Äì Next.js frontend
pnpm dev       # serves http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend performs a health check before every API call; if the backend is unreachable or misconfigured it will surface actionable guidance in the UI.

---

## Testing

The backend ships with a comprehensive, fixture-driven API test suite located at `api/test_api.py`.

```bash
# Run the whole suite with uv (preferred)
uv run --project . pytest api/test_api.py -v

# Optional: coverage report
uv run --project . pytest api/test_api.py --cov=api --cov-report=term-missing
```

Tests cover:

- Authentication failures and success paths
- Request validation (invalid URLs, missing fields)
- `/api/analyze` orchestration, including custom question augmentation
- `/api/chat` conversational flows with history
- Integration with the cached orchestrator + chat agent stubs
- Health endpoints and rate limiting semantics

---

## Deployment Notes

- **Frontend** ‚Äì Designed for Vercel (uses server actions and edge-friendly APIs). Supply the same environment variables via Vercel‚Äôs dashboard.
- **Backend** ‚Äì Can run on Railway or any container-friendly host. Rate limiting relies on in-memory counters by default; for clustered deployments configure a SlowAPI-compatible backend (Redis, Memcached, etc.).
- **Secrets management** ‚Äì Set `API_SECRET_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, and optional API keys in your hosting provider

---

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-page crawling with domain guards and queue limits
- Pluggable semantic search (e.g., DeepInfra or OpenAI embeddings stored in vector DBs)
- Export routes for saved analyses (CSV/PDF/webhook)
- Workspace persistence (swap in Postgres/Redis for the in-memory `AnalysisStore`)
