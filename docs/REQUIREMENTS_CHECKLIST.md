## 📊 Pragmatic Approach

### What We Built
✅ **Customer Value First**: Solves real problem of company research
✅ **Good Enough**: Fully functional, tested, documented
✅ **Easy to Consume**: Simple UI, clear API, examples
✅ **Easy to Change**: Modular design, clear extension points

### What We Didn't Over-Engineer
- ❌ Complex multi-page crawling (add when users need it)
- ❌ Advanced caching infrastructure (simple works fine)
- ❌ Custom ML models (pre-trained is better)
- ❌ Microservices (monolith is simpler)

### Extension Path (When Needed)
- Multi-page scraping: Add `max_pages` parameter
- Web search: Integrate Tavily/SerpAPI
- More fields: Add to Pydantic models
- Persistence: Add database layer
- Scale: Add Redis cache

## 🎓 Key Learnings Demonstrated

1. **AI Engineering**: Effective use of LLMs, prompt engineering, structured outputs
2. **System Design**: Clean architecture, separation of concerns
3. **API Design**: RESTful, well-documented, versioned
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage, mocking, edge cases
5. **DevOps**: Deployment setup, environment management
6. **Documentation**: Clear, complete, with examples
7. **Pragmatism**: Focus on value, avoid over-engineering

## 🚀 Ready for Submission
